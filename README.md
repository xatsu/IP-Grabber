>   **IP Grabber**

❗ Do not forget to not use it for malicious purposes, it's only for educational purposes.
❗ You are solely responsible for your actions, that's obviously not me.

>   **How to use:**
  - My IP Grabber is really easy to use, you just have to host the "index.php" file,
  - there is obviously plenty of free host (like Netlify or 000webhost),
  - when someone goes to your site you will receive lots of information
  - about your target such as their IP etc.
